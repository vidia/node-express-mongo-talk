Talking points
==============

1. We are building an api with NODE.js

2. Mike mentioned it, but NODE is a JS server env.

3. NODE can be used to make apis really easily.

EXPRESS, can be used to make then EASIER!

Here is Hello, World in Node with express

Lets add a POST (Make a POST to / that console.logs)

To read the body you need to require("body-parser")
MIDDLEWARE!

Add it in the package.json

Parrot back the body

Now we have an app that handles GETs and POSTs

QUESTIONS??????

With this knowledge of express I want to make a simple chat API

We need a database

The common DB to use with NODE and EXPRESS, and ANGULAR which Mike used
is Mongodb

Mongodb is a JSON database mongodb.org
Running locally

Mongoose connects it to node
-schemas, functions, etc

My own config module
